# Budget Calculator 

This is a simple budget calculator i created to keep track of the balance we (me and my roommates) had in the pettycash account we created.

# Functionality

For now, it creates a json file containing the balances and lets you add money or substract money from the selected number of accounts. For example, i dont drink tea. So the amount of the ingredients would be subtracted from the other three's account.

# Requirements

# How to compile and run

And to run, type ```java -cp .;gson-2.10.1.jar BudgetCal```
